# The **prayerList** README

This prayer list program is based on the real life inspiration of the prayer list that has been started by Franklin Steele of [Wisdom And Understandning](https://www.youtube.com/@psalm146V5) channel on YouTube. 

Currently I am debating whether to have this stay as a regular program or to advance this into an actual app that you can download on either a computer or mobile phone.

## Beginning Scriptures

These are the beginning scriptures that will be the beginning layer before praying for the names of the people. 

## Names

The names that are chosen for the day is based on which day of the month it is, and the last names of the people sorted alphabetically. Since there are at least 28 days in a month and 26 letters in the alphabet, the first 26 days of the month are strictly reserved for the prayers of the names of people. The month, the week, or the year has contribution at all when it comes to which names are going to be prayed for except for the day of the month.

For example, if it was March 20th, 2024, then we would be praying for the names of people who have last names starting with the letter 't'. If it was December 4th, 2024, then people who have the last names starting with 'd' would be prayed for.

## Ending Scriptures

These are the ending scriptures that will be the ending layer after praying for the names of the people. 

For any of the beginning or ending scriptures, if the scripture has been memroized in the head, it will be labeled as 'memorized' and therefore the scripture will end up being left out of the list.
